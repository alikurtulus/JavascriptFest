                    <h1>Nullish coalescing operator '??'</h1>

                    <h2>Nullish '??'</h2>
                    <code class="code-container">(a ?? b)</code>
                    <code class="code-container">
                        result = (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;

                    <p>
                    In other words, ?? returns the first argument if it’s not null/undefined. Otherwise, the second one.
                    The nullish coalescing operator isn’t anything completely new. It’s just a nice syntax to get the first “defined” value of the two.
                    We can rewrite result = a ?? b using the operators that we already know, like this:
                    </p>
                    <code class="code-container">
                        let user;
                        <br/>
                        alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Anonymous
                    </code>
                </div>

                    <h2>Comparison with ||</h2>
                    <p>
                    The OR || operator can be used in the same way as ??, as it was described in the previous chapter.
                    For example, in the code above we could replace ?? with || and still get the same result:
                    </p>
                    <code class="code-container">
                        let firstName = null;
                        <br>
                        let lastName = null;
                        <br>
                        let nickName = "Supercoder";
                        <br>
                        // shows the first truthy value:
                        alert(firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // Supercoder
                    </code>
                    <ul>The important difference between them is that:
                        <li> || returns the first truthy value.</li>
                        <li> ?? returns the first defined value.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In other words, || doesn’t distinguish between false, 0, an empty string "" and null/undefined.
                        They are all the same – falsy values. If any of these is the first argument of ||,
                        then we’ll get the second argument as the result.In practice though, 
                        we may want to use default value only when the variable is null/undefined.
                        That is, when the value is really unknown/not set.
